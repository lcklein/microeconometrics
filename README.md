# Repository Overview

The reports were created during my master's classes and explore microeconometric techniques applied to Brazilian employment microdata from PNAD (IBGE) for two different time periods and two Brazilian states.

## 1º Report 
  The document focuses on São Paulo and Maranhão during the second quarter of 2012 and 2022. The first exercise applies nonparametric estimation to income data, the second estimates quantile regressions for income, the third employs the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition, and the last utilizes the Recentered Influence Function (RIF).

## 2º Report 
The document focuses on Santa Catarina and Bahia during the second quarter of 2012 and 2022. The exercises explore the differences between Logit and Probit models in the first approach and Poisson and Negative Binomial models in the second, incorporating validation techniques.

## 3º Report 
The document focuses on São Paulo and Piauí during the second quarter of 2012 and 2022. It includes Tobit, Double Hurdle, and Heckman models to explore the variables of interest, along with validation techniques.
